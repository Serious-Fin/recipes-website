        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You will experience the real taste of Lithuania cuisine if you taste this easy-to-cook soup, especially popular 
            in Lithuania - „šaltibarčiai“ (cold beetroot soup, pink soup)! The soup has a shocking bright pink color due to 
            the natural beetroot juice and an incredibly fresh taste due to the most important ingredient in the cold soup 
            - kefir, recognized by nutritionists as one of the healthiest products in the world.
        </p>

            Carlo Petrini, an Italian founder and leader of the famous Slow Food movement, has called Lithuanian 
            cold beetroot soup „the world's most aesthetic cold soup“.
