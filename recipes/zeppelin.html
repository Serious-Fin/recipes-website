            and rich dumplings take some time to make, but they are well worth the effort. Don't be intimidated by the 
            recipe as it has a few steps in order to make each component, including the filling, the dumpling, and the gravy.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice to the raw grated potatoes so they don't turn brown.</li>
            <li>Place them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water.</li>
            <li>Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked riced potatoes, grated onion, and the salt, more to taste. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil.</li>
            <li>To form the zeppelins, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat it flat in the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, using slightly dampened hands, fold the potato mixture around the meat into 
                a football shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used.</li>
